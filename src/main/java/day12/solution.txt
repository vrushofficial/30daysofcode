Algorithm:

For each unvisited node in matrix (and is a island not a water)
        increment no. of island counter, per each island
        perform pre-order DFS on matrix with current node as head

Pre-order DFS
       mark node as visited
       for unvisited node check for recurrent DFS for upper node,
       for unvisited node check for recurrent DFS for lower node,
       for unvisited node check for recurrent DFS for left node,
       for unvisited node check for recurrent DFS for right node
