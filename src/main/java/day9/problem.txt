Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array constructed by summing adjacent elements in preceding rows. Pascal's triangle contains the values of the binomial coefficient.

Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]

Iterative approach to constructing Pascal's triangle used be as dynamic programming because we construct each row based on the previous row.

First, generate the overall triangle list, which will store each row as a sublist.
Then, we check for the special case of 00, as we would otherwise return [1][1].
If numRows > 0 , then
initialize triangle with [1][1] as its first row, and proceed by adding,

i) above-and-to-the-right
ii) above-and-to-the-left
