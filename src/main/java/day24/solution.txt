1] Init two stsack- i). for operand  ii). for operator
2] for each char in expression
        if char is operand push to operand's stack
        else if char is '(' push to operator's stack
        else if char is ')'
            pop from operator's stack
            pop two operands from stack
            perform operation & push result back to operand's stack
            till encounter '(' in operator's stack
         else if char + or - or * or /
            pop from operator's stack
            pop two operands from stack
            perform operation & push result back to operand's stack
            till size of operator's stack >0 and encounter any '(' and priority of operator's peek is greater than priority of current char
            pop operator
            push operator
3] untill operator is empty
    pop from operator's stack
    pop two operands from stack
    perform operation & push result back to operand's stack
